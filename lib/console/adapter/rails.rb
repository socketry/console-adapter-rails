				# Includes the following fields:

				# - `controller`: The name of the controller.
				# - `action`: The action performed.

				# - `method`: The HTTP method of the request.
				# - `path`: The path of the request.
				# - `status`: The HTTP status code of the response.
				# - `view_runtime`: The time spent rendering views in milliseconds.
				# - `db_runtime`: The time spent querying the database in milliseconds.
				# - `location`: The redirect location if any.
				# - `allocations`: The number of allocations performed.
				# - `duration`: The total time spent processing the request in milliseconds.
